                  <p>“Being able to educate your other family members and your friends–that brings a joy to me… Just learning how to live a healthier life, learning and putting all that together I think is definitely worth it. Being able to sleep, being able to practice my mindfulness, being able to have a fairly frequent bowel movement–they may be little things, but they’re things that have helped me to where I am right now where I can actually share what I went through, where I was, and what this program has done for me… I’m glad I did it.”</p>

                  <p>“The Vitamin H’s program has been life changing for me! It’s not a diet, it’s not a get-fit-quick program, there’s no special pills or smoke and mirrors…it’s a lifestyle education investing in me and my health and I’m forever grateful! The program is designed very well and gave me all the tools I needed to learn about food and its preparation, how to safely detoxify my body, find the right physical exercise to benefit me, learn about the most beneficial vitamins and supplements for me, how to think about my health throughout my day and make good lifestyle choices, get the best sleep possible, what changes I can make to make my home and personal care to make my environment as healthy as possible and all the while, being supported by a professional and caring team at The Vitamin H throughout my journey. Benefits? WOW! I’ve lost 25 pounds in six months, I’m stronger and more balanced, I no longer take blood pressure medicine, my cholesterol is lower, I have no joint pain, less inflammation, smoother skin, greater energy, better mental clarity and increased stamina. I feel great and love learning and implementing new ways to improve my daily living. I am almost 60 years old and am confident my next 40 years will be filled with everything I’ve learned from the team at The Vitamin H to stay healthy and active. The program, and their commitment to it, is amazing. Again, I am forever grateful.”</p>

                  <p>“My weight was about 250 lbs., my blood pressure was very heavy. I was about 154/67 and my glucose was way out of the stratosphere… Since then, I’ve lost 30 lbs., my blood glucose has gone down 75 points. I measure my success by three metrics—my weight, my blood pressure, and my blood sugar—since I’m a type 2 diabetic. The day after I started this, I noticed my blood sugar going down 10 points, and it kept going down throughout the whole diet to the point where I’ve lost 75 points, and that’s really pleasing… My blood pressure is down about 20 points, which it wasn’t bad to begin with, but that’s even gone down to around 112, and these are the things that I take my measurements every day. That alone makes it well worth it… This is different because I feel like I’ve learned something that I can carry forward and include in my life which I’ve already done. I’m feeling great… My A1C which had gone up to 6.7 was down to 6.1. Everything as far as the doctor can tell, everything is fantastic. It’s just I feel a whole lot better!”</p>

Every day I look forward to everything that’s new, so I am excited… on top of everything, I was like, ‘You know what, I’m going to trust The Vitamin H!’ The staff is just totally awesome!

                  <p>“I think if we hadn’t started with The Vitamin H, we would have spent a lot more in doctor bills. I think as we got older, we would have saw a lot more detrimental things happening to our health. That was a definite benefit for the both of us. That we don’t have to worry as much about, ‘Are we gonna be sick? Are we gonna need our kids to help us more? Are we going to spend more time doing hospital visits? Doctor visits? More medication?’ I think our quality of life has improved and I would say just overall, we have more energy. We get up early and get going, it’s not like we drag ourselves out of bed and don’t want to face the day. It’s like all right, let’s go! Today’s here, let’s go, let’s do it!”</p>

My numbers were constantly high, and I needed the help to bring down my numbers… At the beginning of the program, my numbers were toward 200/210… I did not feel like doing much at all because I’m constantly worried about this, my numbers. Since completing the program, I am at between 90 and 110 which is very good. My blood sugar dropped… my energy level has boosted so much… This is a program you need to invest in. It is for your health, and as long as you want good health, The Vitamin H is there to help!“</p>

I sleep better, I wake up in the morning refreshed… I finally feel like the future is in my hands. I’ve learned how to eat better. I’ve learned how to exercise better. I’ve learned how to take care of my sciatica issues… I feel like I have the learning, I have the experience, and most of all, I have the desire to want to live this lifestyle for the rest of my life.”</p>
